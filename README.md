# Heroes Rising CSS/HTML Test
A repository containing my submission for a CSS/HTML test.

## Scope
- Create a page with Nine power cards,
- Three Red, Three Blue and Three Green.

The red cards should be mostly identical to the other red cards (same for blue and for green) except for the following:
- Every Red card should have a different tier level (same for blue and green)
- Each of the three numbers in the middle should be different for every card.
- All four tier levels (zero through three) should be represented somewhere on the page.

Bonus extra credit: On one of the cards, triple the word count (so that the text is far too long to fit). Hide the overflow gracefully.
